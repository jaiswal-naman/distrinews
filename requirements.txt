# DistriNews Dependencies
# ======================
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt

# ============================================================================
# CORE ML FRAMEWORK
# ============================================================================

# PyTorch - The ML framework we're using
# Why: Industry standard, has built-in DDP support, excellent for research & production
# Note: Version 2.1+ has improved distributed training
torch>=2.1.0

# HuggingFace Transformers - Pre-trained models
# Why: Provides DistilBERT and other transformer models ready to use
# Without this, we'd have to implement transformers from scratch (weeks of work)
transformers>=4.36.0

# HuggingFace Datasets - Easy dataset loading
# Why: AG News and 1000s of other datasets with one line of code
# Handles downloading, caching, and efficient loading
datasets>=2.16.0

# ============================================================================
# INFERENCE API
# ============================================================================

# FastAPI - Modern web framework
# Why: Fast, automatic docs, type hints, async support
# Better than Flask for ML APIs
fastapi>=0.109.0

# Uvicorn - ASGI server to run FastAPI
# Why: Production-ready server, handles concurrent requests
uvicorn>=0.27.0

# Pydantic - Data validation (used by FastAPI)
# Why: Validates API inputs, provides clear error messages
pydantic>=2.5.0

# ============================================================================
# UTILITIES
# ============================================================================

# TQDM - Progress bars
# Why: Shows training progress, much better UX than print statements
tqdm>=4.66.0

# NumPy - Numerical computing
# Why: Required by PyTorch, useful for metrics
numpy>=1.24.0
