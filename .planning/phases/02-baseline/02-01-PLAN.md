# Phase 2: Baseline Training — Detailed Plan

**Phase Goal:** Create working single-GPU training to establish baseline metrics.

**Requirements Covered:** SGT-01, SGT-02, SGT-03, SGT-04, SGT-05

---

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create Training Utilities
**File:** `training/utils.py`
**What:** Helper functions for training
**Why:** Clean separation of concerns, reusable code

Components:
- `compute_accuracy()` — Calculate accuracy from predictions and labels
- `AverageMeter` — Track running averages (loss, accuracy)
- `get_device()` — Auto-detect best device (GPU/CPU)
- `save_checkpoint()` — Save model weights
- `load_checkpoint()` — Load model weights
- `format_time()` — Format seconds to readable string

### Task 2: Create Single-GPU Training Script
**File:** `training/train_single.py`
**What:** Complete training loop for single GPU/CPU
**Why:** Baseline before distributed training, teaches fundamentals

Components:
- Argument parsing (epochs, batch_size, lr)
- Data loading
- Model creation
- Training loop
- Evaluation
- Checkpointing

Key concepts to explain:
- Forward pass
- Loss computation
- Backward pass (backpropagation)
- Optimizer step
- Learning rate
- Epochs vs batches
- model.train() vs model.eval()

---

## Success Criteria

1. ✓ Training runs on CPU (for local testing)
2. ✓ Loss decreases over time
3. ✓ Accuracy increases over time
4. ✓ Epoch time measured
5. ✓ Checkpoint saved after training
6. ✓ All code has explanatory comments
